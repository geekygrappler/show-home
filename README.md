# Caravan

This is the the static marketing site for Homestead.

It consists of HTML and CSS.

To build the CSS run:

`yarn build-styles`

In the future it will have some dynamic mechanism to detect whether the visitor is a logged in Homestead user and will show a link to the application rather than to login/sign up.

Any further dynamic content should be limited to simple things that should not require a full blown javascript framework/library like React/Vue/Ember.
